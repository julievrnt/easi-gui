# easi-gui

easi-gui is a node-based interface designed to ease the initialisation of models with the library [easi](https://github.com/SeisSol/easi>). No need to write any code anymore ! It opens and saves [YAML](http://yaml.org>) configuration files written with the syntax described by easi. It works the same way as easi does: it possesses two types of nodes, Map and Filter, that are connected together as a tree. If you are not familiar with easi, please read the [easi documentation](https://easyinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>) first.

The documentation can be found on [Read the Docs](https://easi-gui.readthedocs.io) or be downloaded as [PDF Manual](https://easi-gui.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/).
